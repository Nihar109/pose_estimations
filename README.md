# Introduction

This project used for human body movement tracking. 

## Roadmap

- create python virtual envirnment

- install mediapipeline, opencv libraray

- create a module for pose estimation

- upload your video for demo with the help of module

## Before you run the flipkartmobile

1. Clone the repository recursively:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Nihar109/pose_estimations`

If you already cloned and forgot to use `--recurse-submodules` you can run `git submodule update --init`

2. Make sure that you fulfill all the requirements: Python 3.9 or later with all [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Nihar109/pose_estimations/requirements.txt) dependencies installed, To install, run:
